- 👋 Hi, I’m Bijan Hollinger. I always enjoy hearing new ideas so don't be afraid to chat.
- 👀 I’m interested in astrophysics, and with the sheer amount of data I'll potentially be dealing with, it isn't a bad idea to know stuff about coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced programming for robotics, some cool physics things, a bit of philosophy, as well as how to best kick a ball into a net.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on organizatinal software for open source data.
- 📫 How to reach me: bijancodes328@gmail.com.
- 🪐 Fun Fact: I have coding experience (from school) but I'm pretty new to github so any tips or unwanted projects are appreciated.
